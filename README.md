A python RPG game I'm working on js for fun and to work on my python skills.

Currently, there's no visual display system for the game other than a text based format (one big limitation of using python lol), but I am actively working a lot on the backend elements such as implementing  inventory management, NPCs, interactive elements and in the future, exploration and file management.
